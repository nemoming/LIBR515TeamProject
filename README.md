# LIBR515TeamProject
We will create a cohesive interactive dashboard and infographic to show how bird populations and their living ranges in the Lower Mainland have been affected over time. The two biggest factors contributing to these changes are human-caused habitat loss and the pervasiveness of invasive species (Province of British Columbia, 2024). Metro Vancouver’s population now exceeds 3 million people (Kulkarni, 2025), with multiple cities in British Columbia being some of Canada’s fastest-growing population centres in 2022 (Szeto, 2022). The Nature Trust of British Columbia (n.d.) states that biodiversity in the province is currently in good shape, but also that 43% of species native to British Columbia have been assessed as a provincial conservation concern. Many invasive species in British Columbia, such as the European Starling, can thrive in human-made structures while native species cannot (Invasive Species Council of BC, n.d.). Both issues will need the attention of both the public and legislature to address.
