        Our project aims to highlight the loss of native species in the lower mainland of British Columbia due to human-caused habitat loss and the introduction of invasive species through the use of an interactive dashboard and infographic showing the case study of the Western Bluebird. Metro Vancouver‚Äôs population now exceeds 3 million people (Kulkarni, 2025), with multiple cities in British Columbia being some of Canada‚Äôs fastest-growing population centres in 2022 (Szeto, 2022). The Nature Trust of British Columbia (n.d.) states that biodiversity in the province is currently in good shape, but also that 43% of species native to British Columbia have been assessed as a provincial conservation concern. Many invasive species in British Columbia, such as the European Starling, can thrive in human-made structures while native species cannot (Invasive Species Council of BC, n.d.), which severely limits nesting sites when combined with deforestation. Both issues will need the attention of the public and legislatures to address.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our project focuses on informing community scientists who frequently use birding apps, such as eBird, and the general public living in areas experiencing habitat and biodiversity loss. We hope to educate others in order to spread awareness, particularly on how human activity has affected local bird populations and ways the average person can help.

        As you can see when comparing the views ‚ÄúForest Hectares Lost by Region and Year‚Äù and ‚ÄúInvasive and Native Species Counts Over Time by Region,‚Äù the loss of forest habitat is not the only factor in population changes. The Squamish-Lillooet region sees spikes in hectares of forest lost between 2009 and 2021, yet the populations of both native and invasive bird species remain relatively stable. This could be due to the fact that surrounding urban sprawl affects rising invasive numbers more than forest loss or that the numbers are skewed from single sightings of large native groups, which can be seen when filtering the map view for the Squamish-Lillooet area. Part of it may be due to bias in our dataset. The crowd-sourced nature of eBird data means the low amounts of sightings in either category could suggest that there are not many eBird users in the area compared to more populous regions.

      <p>
        In Fraser Valley and Metro Vancouver, areas with more urban development, invasive species numbers are increasing exponentially (See ‚ÄúInvasive and Native Species Counts Over Time by Region‚Äù). ‚ÄúInvasive vs Native Numbers by Year‚Äù shows the difference between the populations of invasive and native species is growing when taking the entire Lower Mainland into account.

        Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the effects of introducing new species into an ecosystem. Our timeline takes a look at the introduction of European Starlings in North America and its effects on the Western Bluebird in Vancouver.

      <p>The Invasive Species Council of British Columbia has many resources on ways to help protect biodiversity in your area. You can even become a member!</p>
      <p><b>Things you can do to play your part:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Report sightings of invasive species on the ISCBC reporting app, iNaturalist, or eBird</li>
        <li>Keep your cats indoors</li>
        <li>Advocate for the protection of forests against logging and development</li>
        <li>Be aware of fire advisories in your area to prevent wildfires that can cause habitat loss</li>
        <li>Properly dispose of non-native plants from your garden</li>
        <li>Plant native species to reduce lawns and do not use pesticide</li>
        <li>Never release domesticated animals into the wild</li>
        <li>Support your local bird sanctuaries</li>
      </ul>
